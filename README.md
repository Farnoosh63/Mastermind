# Mastermind-ember-js

Mastermind is a game of wits where you have to crack the color code in ten turns. Guess four colors in any order to attempt to crack the code. You will have to strategize based upon the results your given for each attempt: black pegs mean you guessed the right color in the right position, white means you guessed the right color but in the wrong position. This project was made to demonstrate basic Ember functionality.
